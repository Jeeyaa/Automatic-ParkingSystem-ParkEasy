ParkEasy is an innovative automated parking management system designed to revolutionize traditional parking and ticket management processes. This intelligent system eliminates the need for human intervention, offering a cost-effective and efficient solution for managing unmanned parking facilities. ParkEasy leverages state-of-the-art Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology, incorporating Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract license plate information from vehicle images.

Key Features:

1. ANPR Technology: ParkEasy employs Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology to detect and recognize license plates from live video feeds captured by webcams.

2. Efficient Entry Logging: Upon license plate detection, the OCR algorithm identifies alphanumeric characters on the license plate and logs the plate number along with the entry timestamp into the system database.

3. Automated Payments: Customers are automatically charged based on their parking duration when exiting the parking facility. This streamlined payment process is convenient for customers, as the fees are deducted directly from their local e-wallet.

4. Dynamic Pricing: ParkEasy offers dynamic pricing, calculating parking fees in real-time according to the time a vehicle spends within the parking lot. This ensures fair and accurate pricing for each customer.

5. Seamless Data Handling: Entry and exit data, including log reports, are transmitted to the client-side processing unit in real-time. This data is then securely stored in the central database server.

6. User-Friendly Web Interface: ParkEasy provides an intuitive web-based interface hosted locally, allowing easy and secure access to all parking data. An additional secure administrator login grants access to historical and current vehicle information within the parking lot.
